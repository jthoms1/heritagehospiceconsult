	    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
		<p>It is the objective of Heritage Hospice Consultants, LLC (HHC) to work with our clients in order to maximize each agency’s potential.  Since we know each company is unique, HHC will review each client’s individual situation.  Based on this assessment, findings of this review will be prepared detailing our conclusions regarding strengths as well as recommendations on those items which HHC concludes will improve that company’s profitability and operations.  After a strategy has been determined, we work with our clients to implement the steps necessary to ensure this plan is successful.  Our goal is excellent service in order to provide an outcome of outstanding results with the CEO making a personal promise that no other firm will take a bigger interest in your success!</p>
        </section>
        <section id="philosophy">
	    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
	    <p>As a hospice administrator, our CEO was responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of any agency’s program.  With the additional responsibility of being the administrator of a start-up hospice, the CEO was also responsible for determining the strategy the company would take in order to grow their business.  It was imperative that the hospice’s census grow to a healthy size for three reasons:  1) Return a reasonable percentage on those partners’ initial investments, 2) Deliver an excellent service to their customers, and 3) Provide proper support for their employees and volunteers.</p>
	    <p>Each of these objectives is equally important and supports one another in achieving the goal of creating as well as growing a successful organization.  Businesses must attain financial goals which are ultimately accomplished by providing a service that someone wants.  Outstanding service is delivered by excellent employees who are supported by financially stable companies.  If a services organization is able to maintain a healthy balance between return on investment and investment in its people, management can focus on providing a viable service to its customers so that its business mission is met which allows a company to grow.  This is the philosophy of HHC and our company wants to work with you to achieve your agency’s objectives.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="focus">
	    <h2>Our Focus</h2>
	    <p>HHC understands that business circumstances differ and that a template approach will not be the answer for every agency.  This is why our company’s approach is to visit with management and other personnel to understand a hospice’s current situation so that new business strategies can be formulated to improve operations.  Depending on a hospice’s needs and requests, all aspects of an agency’s operation can be reviewed in order to allow for a comprehensive report with detailed recommendations regarding various functions of a client’s business.  Recommendations incorporated through this evaluation will result in proposed future business strategies.</p>
