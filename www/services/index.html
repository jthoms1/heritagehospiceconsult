          <h2>Our Services</h2>
	  <p>It is the goal of Heritage Hospice Consultants, LLC (HHC) to identify solutions which meet each client’s unique needs.  To accomplish this, HHC has several service levels available in order to support you.  HHC will work with each client to stay within budget and arrive at a mutually beneficial payment plan.  The following tranches are offered to satisfy our clients’ needs as well as stay within company budgets so that clients only pay for services which are required.</p>
 
          <h4>Full Operational Review</h4>
	  <p>HHC will visit agencies to review operations in order to provide a full evaluation which will include a comprehensive plan to reach our clients’ goals.  These strategies could entail financial, marketing and operational improvements.  A report will be prepared listing tasks performed as well as findings and recommendations.  From this review, a comprehensive plan will be formulated in order to improve each agency’s operations.  The ultimate goal for HHC is to provide the best solutions possible to help build a moat around your business.  This service also provides for six months free phone consultation after the site visit is concluded.  This is the only service type provided where a visit is part of the service unless specifically requested.</p>
 
	  <h4>Partial Operational Review</h4>
	  <p>HHC will conduct a client interview by phone and provide solutions based upon this conversation.  A report summarizing our phone meeting including recommendations will also be provided.</p>
 
	  <h4>Financial Review</h4>
	  <p>HHC will perform a financial statements examination in order to determine a client’s operational metrics as well as review the company’s Balance Sheet for unusual items focusing on those which affect cash flow.  Operational metrics will include items such as a break-even analysis, cash flow evaluation and profit projections based upon different census points. This service could also include a separate accounts receivable analysis as listed in the Accounts Receivable Review section.  A report will be provided detailing our findings and recommendations.</p>
 
	  <h4>Human Resources Review</h4>
	  <p>After review of the current structure, HHC will execute a strategy with client input to optimally align employee goals with company goals.  A report will be provided with recommendations detailed.  </p>
 
	  <h4>Accounts Receivable Review</h4>
	  <p>Cash flow is essential to any organization’s prosperity.  If this function is not reviewed properly, company profits will not be maximized.  HHC will examine the accounts receivable (A/R) function of a client’s agency in order to determine if the processes employed ensure all potential revenue is ultimately billed and collected.  Our clients have the option of using HHC to perform one month’s reconciliation of an agency’s A/R to compare with their own records or to only use HHC to provide spreadsheet templates and the process to perform this function.  Clients can also choose to have HHC perform this process on a monthly basis.  Written documentation provided will be dependent upon the level of service requested by the client.</p>
 
	  <h4>Marketing Review</h4>
	  <p>HHC works with its clients to reach previously unobtainable markets.  After determining current strategies, HHC will recommend proven methods to increase the number of an agency’s referral sources.  A report will be provided detailing our findings and recommendations.  </p>
	</section>
	<section> 
	  <h2>OTHER STRATEGIC SERVICES</h2><br>
	  <h4>Start-Up Planning</h4>
	  <p>HHC serves its clients by providing methodology in order to plan a successful business as well as proven steps necessary to launch a hospice agency profitably.  This is an extremely important business process that requires proper planning and strategic rationale.  HHC discusses a variety of topics with its clients prior to starting a hospice and if the decision is made to open an agency, HHC will work with its customers until Medicare certification is received.  HHC offers assistance in areas such as administration, recruiting, budgeting, cash flow projections, accounting and education.</p>
 
	  <h4>Sale of Business</h4>
	  <p>HHC has been through the sale process and assists its clients in functions such as determining a fair agency valuation, reviewing legal documents regarding the sale in order to eliminate potentially costly requirements and providing an experienced perspective from someone who has been through this challenging, yet potentially rewarding event.</p>
